# Project Description

Our project will focus primarily on simulating COVID testing environments run by the University Health Services at UC Berkeley. We are simulating two different COVID testing environments: Surveillance test in Rec Sport Facility (RSF), and Symptomatic and Exposure test in Durant side. The goals of the project are to: 
1. better understand the design of the current COVID testing environment
2. identify and address any inefficiencies in the system that contribute to longer wait times in the physical testing environments and/or the process needed from the point of the test to getting the result to the client.
3. optimize the system by minimizing waiting time and attack any bottlenecks occur on the system.
